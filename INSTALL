Strator consists of three main parts:
	scribble_r[_ssl]
	strator.html
	*.js

To install and run, build scribble_r or scribble_r_ssl and start executing on the same host where the 
HTML will be served from.  Add the HTML and javascript files to a directory where the host's http server
can find them.
