Strator is an HTML-5 scribble board which allows multiple concurrent users to concurrently update and view
a blackboard.  The HTML-5 is javascript based and when invoked establishes a websocket session (either in 
the clear or via ssl) to a scribble_r repeater.  Items placed by the user on the blackboard are sent
to the repeater and forwered to all other connected strator processes which have joined the group.

Groups are a way of organising multiple blackboards via the same repeater, and can be password protected
and/or read only.  A password protracted group allows a Strator process to join the group only if the 
user provides the correct process. A read only group will supply all Strator processes updates, but only
the Strator which creaed the group will have the abilty to write on the board such that the changes are
forward to all members of the group. 

The doc directory contains a user's manual which can be formatted into HTML and linked from the main
Strator html file.
