The documentation for Strator is written using {X}fm which is a text formatting utility similar 
to IBM's DCF script, LaTex, or [t]roff.  It is availble to build from github/scottdaniels/xfm.


The generated html file should be placed into the same directory that the main strator.html file
is located (from an http server perspective).  There is a link in the main html to the doc which
will be broken if it is not.
